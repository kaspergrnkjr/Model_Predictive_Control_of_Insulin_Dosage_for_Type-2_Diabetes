%In this example we compare between two different patients with different
%lifestyles and medications.

%% Define Two patients:

%Assume both patients have the same parameters and initial conditions:
p1 = T2Dp;
p2 = T2Dp;

%% Define Meals: 
%Assume that the two patients have the same meal plans: 

%The method (perday) lets you define any input for day and repeated for all
%the simulation days:

%Say the patient eats three meals: 7:00, 12:00, and 18:00 :
Mealtimes = [7*60 12*60 18*60]; %In minutes from 00:00.
MealSizes = [30 80 150]; %In grams.

[m, mt]=p1.perday(Mealtimes,MealSizes);

p1.Meals = m;
p2.Meals = m;

%% Define insulin treatments: 
%The first patient takes only long acting insulin once per day of dose size
%Ula = 30 [U]
Ulatimes = 0;
UlaSizes = 30;

[ula1, ulat1]=p1.perday(Ulatimes,UlaSizes);

p1.Ula = ula1;

%As for the second patient, the patient takes long acting insulin with size
%50 [U] once per day in addtion to a long acting insulin
Ulatimes = 0;
UlaSizes = 50;

[ula2, ulat2]=p2.perday(Ulatimes,UlaSizes);

p2.Ula = ula2;


%Patient 2 also takes fast acting insulin dose of 20 [U]:
Ufatimes = 17.75*60;
UfaSizes = 20;

[ufa2, ufat2]=p2.perday(Ufatimes,UfaSizes);

p2.Ufa = ufa2;


%% Metformin 

%Patient 2 takes a 500 mg dose of metformin everyday 15 mins before dinner:
Mtimes = 17.75*60;
Msizes = 500; 

[um, umt]=p1.perday(Ufatimes,UfaSizes);

p1.Um = um;

%Patient 2 also take a metformin dose everyday 15 mins before dinner but
%they take double the dose.

p2.Um = 2*um;

%% Physical Activity

%Only patient 1 exercises everyday between 16 to 16:30 raising his heart
% beats by 40 bpm from its base according to a trapazoidal function

%You can use the trapazoidal method to define a trapazoidal signal and then
%repeat it for the simulation days: (Future work: expand the perday method
%to include a trapazoidal and rectangle option).

y = p1.Rampf(40,16*60,16.1*60,16.4*60,16.5*60,(0:p1.dt:(24*60-1)));

PA = repmat(y,[1,p1.Nd]);

p1.HRd = PA; 

%% Stress

%Patient 2 suffer from stress on the second day with a value of 0.3 between
%10:00 to 16:00

y = p2.Rampf(0.4,10*60+24*60, 11*60+24*60, 15*60+24*60, 16*60+24*60, p1.T);

p2.Stress = y; 


%% Simulation
p1.Simulation;

X1 = p1.X;
time1 = p1.time;

p2.Simulation;

X2 = p2.X;
time2 = p2.time;

%% Plotting
